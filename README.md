# The-Hunt
Your objective is to hunt and kill the pesky rabbit!

Track the rabbit down and try to catch it. If you think you
have a shot, take it! However, be careful has you have
limited ammo to use against the rabbit. Like any good
hunter, you'll need to sit, wait, and listen for the rabit.

Good Luck!
